# Brainfuck Binary to Decimal Converter

A simple (though not optimized for memory or time) Brainfuck code to convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

## How to Use

To see the memory layout and how the program operates while running, you can use the following online Brainfuck interpreter:

Simply paste the code into the interpreter and input your binary number to observe the conversion process.
Or you can use whatever interpreter you find working.

## Resources

The divmod algorithm used in this code is based on the implementation found here:

## ToDo

- [ ] Add detailed comments to explain each step of the code.
- [ ] Optimize the code for better memory and time efficiency.
- [ ] It currently handles numbers from 0 to 255. Add support for larger binary numbers.
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid binary inputs. (If it supports)
